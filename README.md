# Cat-and-dog-Classification
Classification of cats and dogs using convolution neural network

This takes place in five steps

1) Creating convolution Layer

2)Max Pooling and the Flattening

3)Added two hidden Layers 

4)Using keras image preprocessing import image dataset and train the model using train set and test set

5)Testing against new dataset
